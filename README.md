# Predicting Epilepsy via Data Analytics
Our objective was to accurately classify the discrete categorical bins for each of the y labels 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for potential medical use, enabling quick preliminary Epilepsy diagnosis by medical personnels. 

We cleaned up the dataset with various digital filters and utilised Fourier Series Equations to visualise brainwaves of epilepsy patients in EpilepsyFFT.ipynb. Following, we applied Python in Jupyter Notebooks and categorised excel data of brain scans with code utilising sklearn, xgboost and more popular libraries in EpilepsyML.ipynb. All in all, we used 10 different Machine Learning techniques to categorise the dataset in this project, achieving up to 97.35% prediction accuracy in the test set.


### y-labels:
- 1 - Recording of seizure activity
- 2 - They recorder the EEG from the area where the tumor was located
- 3 - Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area
- 4 - eyes closed, means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed
- 5 - eyes open, means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open
